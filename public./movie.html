<h2>Movies</h2>
<h3>Fast and furious</h3>
<p>
    The dinamic, passion, family, responsibility - thats how i would discribe this movie.

<h3>Terrifier</h3>
<p> 
    As a horror artist, horror lover and especially clowns lover - I'm addicted to this movie.<br />
    When i had watches first part, it became my inspiration for my makeup on halloween.<br />
    I'm waiting on a fourth part, which have to be realesed in 2026.

<h3>Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum</h3>
<p>
    When i had tired of basic and boring americans scripts for horror/thriller movies, i wanted to find something new. <br />
    And as i'm anime lover and lover of Japan, i started searching other.<br />
    Then i found Korean movies. This movie i my the most favourite.

<h2>Anime</h2>
<p>
    Anime is mine everything.<br />
    You will never know, how much i love anime.<br />
    This group of 5 words holds me. When i'm lost, i just go on jut.su, my favoutire anime or I search new piece.<br />
    Then I turn off phone, notifications - simply everything, and i enjoy the moment.
</p>
<p>So below, you can see my top 3....</p>
<h3>Haikyu</h3>
<p>
    I don't have no words, how i would describe this anime, because everything is inside me. If you could go inside me, you would saw all what is connected with Haikyu.<br />
</p>
<h3>My hero academia</h3>
<p>
    My holder.<br />
    Two years ago, 2023 year was mine the hardest year, i was mostly broke down.<br />
    Only MHA was holding me. It showed me, who am i. 
    And that nothing can break me. I just have to follow my dreams, and keep rebembering who I am.
</p>
<h3>Solo leveling</h3>
<p> 
    Same as with Haikyu.<br />
    I'm just waiting new season in 2026-2027.
